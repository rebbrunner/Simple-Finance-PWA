## Description

Very basic progressive web app that can be installed and used offline.  Responsive so ui will adjust to different platforms.  Created with only basic html, css, and javascript

## Notes/Bugs

- Navigation menus do nothing
- On android when offline adding a new item will navigate to an error page - backing up though will reveal data successfully updates.  Possibly related to using button inside form, since deletion buttons don't display this behavior.
